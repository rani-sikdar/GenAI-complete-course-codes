# 🧠 GenAI Codes: NLP, Deep Learning & Sequence Modeling

Welcome to **GenAI Codes** – a practical, hands-on repository designed to help you **master Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **deep learning techniques** one notebook at a time.

Whether you're just getting started with **tokenization** or preparing to implement **RNNs and LSTMs**, this repo is for learners who want to build strong NLP foundations and eventually dive into **Generative AI and LLMs**.  
No more getting stuck at the basics. Let's bridge that learning gap together! 🚀
